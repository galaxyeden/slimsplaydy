# Slim Splaydy

This is the real Slim Splaydy. All the other Slim Splaydies are just imitating.

It's a 34-key split ergo layout with a bit of splay and quite a bit of stagger, using Kailh PG1316S ultra-low-profile switches. The result should be extemely slim. I'm using a nice!nano controller, SMD to the board upside down with a cutout for the components, so it chould only be 1.6mm above the PCB surface. The PCB is also cut away where the battery goes, and the case includes a battery holder, allowing up to a 3.0mm battery. The case also has holes for magnets to sit just below the surface, allowing the two sides to magnetically clasp together for transport. When closed up this way the two halves should come in around 8mm thick.

The design is intended to be very easy to assemble. Fvery component on the board is SMD, and all are on the front side. So it should be buildable in one run on a hot plate. Should not even need a soldering iron!

This repo includes the ergogen config file, kicad PCB and schematic files for both left and right halves, and STEP files of all case pieces. Production files and a build guide will follow once everything is finalized.

Here are some pictures...
