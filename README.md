Slim Splaydy

This is the real Slim Splaydy. All the other Slim Splaydies are just imitating.

It's a 34-key split ergo layout with a bit of splay and quite a bit of stagger, using Kailh PG1316S ultra-low-profile switches. The result should be extemely slim. I'm using a nice!nano controller, SMD to the board upside down with a cutout for the components, so it chould only be 1.6mm above the PCB surface. Which, incidentally, is the same height as the switches when depressed.

Fvery component on the board is SMD, and all are on the front side. So it should be buildable in one run on a hot plate. Should not even need a soldering iron!

Not much else to say right now, as it's still very much a work in progress...will update this as I get closer to production.
